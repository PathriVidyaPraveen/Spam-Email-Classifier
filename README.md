# Spam-Email-Classifier-Tinkerer-s-Lab-Project-

This repo contains source code of a ML model of Spam Email Classifier. This was done as a part of Tinkerer's Lab Club Project. 

I chose this project because it provides hands-on experience in ML, Natural Language Processing, and Data Preprocessing, which are essential for building real-world applications. I am particularly fascinated by how ML models can parse and understand human language to make intelligent decisions.
This project allows me to explore text classification, model training, and optimization, which are fundamental in spam detection, recommendation systems, and other AI-driven applications. By working on spam classification, I wanted to explore more in areas of NLP and classification systems, helping me build a strong foundation for future ML projects.

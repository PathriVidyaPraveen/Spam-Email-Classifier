# Spam-Email-Classifier-Tinkerer-s-Lab-Project-


Disclaimer : Project currently under development.


This repo contains source code of a ML model of Spam Email Classifier. This was done as a part of Tinkerer's Lab Club Project. 

I chose this project because it provides hands-on experience in ML, Natural Language Processing, and Data Preprocessing, which are essential for building real-world applications. I am particularly fascinated by how ML models can parse and understand human language to make intelligent decisions.
This project allows me to explore text classification, model training, and optimization, which are fundamental in spam detection, recommendation systems, and other AI-driven applications. By working on spam classification, I wanted to explore more in areas of NLP and classification systems, helping me build a strong foundation for future ML projects.

Problem Statement: 
Build a binary classifier to differentiate spam and non-spam emails.

Please look into the csv file in this repo emails.csv for the dataset I have been working on.

Resources and learning material are provided in this repo for the above project.

About Dataset
Dataset Name: Spam Email Dataset

Description:
This dataset contains a collection of email text messages, labeled as either spam or not spam. Each email message is associated with a binary label, where "1" indicates that the email is spam, and "0" indicates that it is not spam. The dataset is intended for use in training and evaluating spam email classification models.

Columns:

text (Text): This column contains the text content of the email messages. It includes the body of the emails along with any associated subject lines or headers.

spam_or_not (Binary): This column contains binary labels to indicate whether an email is spam or not. "1" represents spam, while "0" represents not spam.

Usage:
This dataset can be used for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification and spam detection. Researchers and data scientists can train and evaluate machine learning models using this dataset to build effective spam email filters.
